### Purpose
This is an assignment to bring in outside data or using fake data using faker, into python for dealing with Panda.
The project takes world population data of 2022 and 1980 and finds the top 7 countries with population growth and the 
bottom 5 countries with declining population. Using Pandas and matplotlib created a bar graph of top growth countries
and the bottom 5 declining population countries. The project when ran correctly should give you 2 graphs with the
population growth in green, and the decline countries in red.

### Installation

pip install PyQt6
pip install matplotlib
pip install -r requirements.txt
